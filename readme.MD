## Running the project

This project is set up to read a CSV file named ```examplefile.csv``` that should be in the project's root directory. Replace this with the path to your own CSV file in the ```read_from_file("./examplefile.csv")``` line in the main function.

In the command line, type ```cargo run``` while in the project's directory to compile and run the project. If all is set up correctly, you will see the contents of your CSV file printed to the console.
